			<h2>Mt. Everest</h2>
			<p>Known for its immense height, the Earth Head Mount Everest is the epitome of mountains and mountaineering. Every once in a while, new mountaineering records are made and legends are born. The ultimate aim of all these mountaineers is to conquer Mount Everest. There is some kind of competition among people to knit the intrepid tale of mountaineering. It is located in the Khumbu region of Nepal. It is mainly known as SAGARMATHA in Nepal and Chomolungma "Holy Mother", among Tibetians.</p>

			<h2>Janaki Temple</h2>
			<p>Dedicated to Goddess Sita, Janaki Mandir is the biggest temple in Nepal located in Janakpur. It is constructed at the place where Goddess Sita was born. The attraction is now considered as a religiously important monument and a heritage site but is still an active temple for devotees. Anybody seeking a slice of the legend of Ramayana must visit the divine Janaki Temple. Janaki Mandir was built covering an area of 4,860 square feet with a temple that measures 164 feet (50 m) high. Constructed of marble and stone, the temple features 60 rooms that are all decorated and showcase the flag of Nepal.</p>

			<h2>Tilicho Lake</h2>
			<p>One of the highest lakes in the world is Tilicho Lake, which is found in Nepal's Annapurna range in the Himalayas. It is a sacred body of water to the locals and a dream of a travel destination for trekkers and adventurers from all over the world. Its elevation of 4,919 meters (16,138 feet) adds to the seclusion and charm that comes because of its tranquility. The lake's magnificent mountain background and pure waters draw tourists looking for an off-the-beaten-path excursion. Trekking to Tilicho Lake is a path that is widely admired as people discover the area's untamed nature and stunning beauty. It is located in the Manang district of Nepal which has a plethora of other natural travel destinations it can boast about.</p>

			<h2>Machhapuchhare</h2>
			<p>Machhapuchhare – which translates to "fishtail" – is an iconic 6,993m mountain in central Nepal's Annapurna range that contains three of the world's 10 highest peaks. And yet, Machhapuchhare effortlessly steals the show, thanks to its position far from the much higher peaks of the Annapurna range, where it stands isolated and appears tall despite its humbler height. It has an unbelievably beautiful appearance. Anyone who has seen the mountain at least in pictures, not to mention seeing it with their own eyes, will agree with this. Its twin peaks have such a pronounced and steep peak that it seems to pierce the defenseless sky. When you are on the west side of Machapuchare, you can understand why it is called “Fishtail. A little play of the imagination and you can vividly see the figure of a huge fish’s tail, with fins on the paired tops. A crystal white, shimmering haze of snow shrouds the mountain from time to time, accentuating even more strongly the beholder’s attention to the majesty, confident power, and even mythical power of the mountain.
